BRAN G AND VISUAL

LOGO

The Butter Chicken Spot logo is just that, a butter chicken
spot. It is a simple and unique logo.

It is a simple chicken. The diamond that represents the
beak, can also second as a tab of butter.

In the monochromatic versions of the logo, the beak

makes the logo look more like an “o”.

The green eyes represent the methi pieces in the butter
chicken dish.

The head of the chicken is handdrawn to make it feel more
like a drop of sauce on a table.

The colors shown here are the only colors allowed for the
logo unless there is a seasonal promotion or exception to
change the color.

LOGOTYPE

The Butter Chicken Spot logotype is locked up in a circle
(the spot) and the type has an imperfect organic feel
to imitate the way the sauce would move. The chicken

head logo doubles as the “o” in “spot.” The green brackets
double as the methi pieces.

These logotypes are the basic circle logotypes, the
colored one for signage, stickers, etc, and the black and
white one for documents.
